  This repository contains <code><b>Battery Notifier Application</b></code>.ü§ì
  <br><code><b>BatNotify</b></code> has been created as a simple <code><b>Visual Basic</b></code> script which can be used to get you notified when your Laptop's battery level reaches fully charged.

</p>
<br>

# Introduction :-
  When your Laptop‚Äôs battery level reaches low, Windows 10 alerts you with a notification to plug the power source.
  <br>But there is no feature in Windows 10 to notify you when the battery is fully charged.
  <br>Keeping the Laptop plugged in even after the battery is fully charged affect its health significantly.
  <br>Also, if you keep charging for a longer period then battery gets heated.
  <br>This is not good for the battery‚Äôs health.
  <br>It is advised to keep your battery‚Äôs charge between 30-90 percent so that your battery lasts for long.
  <br>If you are not using any battery manager software, still want to be notified?
  <br>Don‚Äôt worry, you can make use of a simple script to get the job done.
  <br>The script was written to notify when the battery level reaches 95%.
